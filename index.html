      <h2> Was Eli manning a big risk</h2>
      <p> Yes indeed Eli manning was a big risk with him beating Tom Brady's patorits twice in the superbowls. It was Eli or Phillp Rivers but Eli is a leader and a winner besides Phillp Rivers who is maybe more accurate due to him being one of the best QB's at passing yards per game.</p>
